# Performance Reviews

Here, I digest everything from weekly into performance review for the quarter, half-year, or year. I try to align what's already been done with the business goals as much as possible. I've learned, rather painfully, that performance review is not about performance, but about rhetoric. So as much as you can tune your experience through the year into whatever goals you want from your performance review, the better. Regardless, this process will be a lot easier since you already have the data from this framework.

# File naming

The name of the file should reflect the performance cycle it represents, scoped to the year. Something like [`2023-H1.md`](./2023-H1.md)

Use whichever closely aligns to performance reviews in your place of work.
