# Journals

Here's where I log my day-to-day.

Information here should be as free-flow as possible. I usually write this up diary-style — hence the name. It captures my day in its entirety. I could be more verbose depending on the energy levels through the day, or it could just be a list of bullets.

## File naming

The name of the file should be `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

This keeps a nice chronological view of the files — I sort my files chronologically. This allows me to digest my week

## Template

- Tasks I worked on
- Conversations with coworkers
- Problems solved
- Things I read
