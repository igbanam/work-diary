# Work Diary

Some details about the project would be here.

If I need to put some trackers, deliverables, stakeholders, and everything else to keep me honest on the project, this is where it's done.

Contents of this folder is free form. It holds all document artefacts of the project as much as it can hold. I limit these to text-based files. So CSV, Markdown, Text, and so on.
