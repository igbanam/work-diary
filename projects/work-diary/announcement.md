# Work Diary is launched 🎉

Now you can work with your team and your managers in a more deterministic way. Work never has to hit you in the face. With WorkDiary™ you now have a clear view of how your day to day interactions at work build you into the career you want.

We saw that most people go through the motions at work, and seldom take control of what's going on. This made managers and employees alike have some frustration through work.

We created work diary to delineate the barrage of data which the worker has to handle through their work day. WorkDiary™ is a simple framework which allows you consciously architect and build your career, while tracking its development every step of the way.
