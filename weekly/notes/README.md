# Weekly

At the end of every week, I do a mini retrospective on myself.

```
┌──────────┐  personal retrospective   ┌─────────────┐
│ journals │ ────────────────────────> │ weekly note │
└──────────┘                           └─────────────┘
```

The form of this weekly note is prosaic. It's basically a reflection and compilation of the week. I try to stay away from that "What went well" mechanism. Course-correction happens implicitly as I read through the notes and go through the process. Since I am the only unit within the retrospective, this tends to work fine.

This then feeds into to performance reviews

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐
│ weekly/note │ ──> │ performance reviews │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘
```

## File naming

The names of the file should reflect the week number (1 - 52), scoped per year: [`2023-04.md`](./2023-04.md)
