# Meetings

I like to keep track of what was discussed in a note. This way, when next I'm in a meeting with this person, I can continue from where we last left off. This helps me create a linear congruence where time is broken and interactions are varied. Linear congruence is good because both me, and the meeting can "drive the point home" on the emergent determinism.
